# Business Site

I have created a business website for online painting classes.
The main idea was to include responsive hero image, sign-up form and FAQ section accordion.

## The problem

First of all, I made a design in figma.com. It was very helpful, because when I started to code, I did not have to think about the design very much. I already had color numbers and I new where I want to position the title, button, form and so on.

I started coding with html structure (hero image, nav-bar, form, accordion and footer), then I moved to css styling.  I used flexbox to create the layout for most of the website. I realized that I have learnt a lot from the previous project, because html and css part went quite smooth. My mistake was not applying mobile first approach (I started with desktop) and it took me too much time to make website responsive. I believe with mobile first approach it would be much easier. 

I made several animations to make the site more interesting. And most of all, I'm proud of the animated paint brush in the navigation section.

Main struggle was with the FAQ accordion part. I could not understand JavaScript code. I could copy paste it, but I really wanted to understand it. And I also had a typo in my code that took me a while to realize. Nevertheless, live sessions with Van and Maksymilian helped bring clarity and I was able to make the FAQ section the way I wanted (including plus/minus icon).

If I had more time I would have styled checkboxes and radio buttons and also use BEM methodology to my project.
